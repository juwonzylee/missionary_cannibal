# missionary_cannibal

## Problem Explanation
- Initial state: there are three missionaries and three cannibals on the left of the river.
- Goal state: all six of them cross to the right of the river.
- Rule: A boat may carry up to two people at the same time. If cannibals outnumber missionaries on either bank, the missionaries die.

## Implementation Overview
Using python, I used the breadth-first search to find the optimum solution.
